    <p style="font-size:30px;">One of the more popular incarnations of the
      Übermensch philosophy is found in David Fincher’s
      1999 film Fight Club, based on Chuck Palahniuk’s 1996 book of the same name. A number of theorists and fans have taken to calling Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt’s destructive character in the film, the quintessential Nietzschean
      Übermensch for his determination to liberate society from itself under the guise ofanti-capitalism.
