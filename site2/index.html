        Nietzscheen ideas in Fight Club
    </div>
    <p style="font-size:30px;">Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the most significant philosophers of the nineteenth
      century, and his influence upon modern thought has outshone that of many of his
      contemporaries. His writing explored the concepts of morality, religion, reason and primarily,
      the effects of these upon the human condition, due to their oppressive and corrupting nature.
      Nietzsche’s “immoralist” philosophy proved incredibly controversial at the time he was
      writing, due to the fact that society was still very much under the cosh of organised religion,
      something which Nietzsche regularly referred to as anti-life.</p>
